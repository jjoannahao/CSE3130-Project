# CSE3130-Project

Basic brick breaker game featuring two levels!

## Instructions for Use
Run the game using Pycharm's run button at the top right of the IDE. If the program doesn't run, close Pygame and re-open project folder and then right-click on the ```main.py``` file and manually run the program.

If you run out of lives and lose the game, the window will automatically close; if you win the game, the window will also automatically close. Note the parting message in Pycharm's terminal if you aren't sure whether you won or lost the game :)

## Extra Features
1. Starting menu screen with instructions (seen before the brick breaker game starts)
2. 3 lives incorporated (top right of the screen will feature the health indicators)
